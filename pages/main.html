    <h1>Main Page everyone</h1>
    <h3> {{name}} </h3>

     <p>This is an example for single page application . The header , footer and all the common elements are only downloaded once. This approach is the prefereed way to building single page application because we are only using the ngRoute method to direct the hash values and get the contents and paste there in the particular page .</p>



    <p> You can actually add as many items or things you want in the pages and just add them in the $routeProvider. </p>
    <h3>Below is a text box displaying the same name which shared across multiple #pages. </h3>

    <input type="text" ng-model="name"/>
